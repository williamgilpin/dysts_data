This repository contains code and benchmark outputs for the zero-shot chaos forecasting benchmark.

The scripts used to run the benchmarks may be found in the `scripts` directory. These include `.py` files for running the benchmarks, and `.sbatch` files for submitting jobs to a cluster.

The folders `zero-shot` and `trained` contain `.npz` files with the benchmark outputs. These are raw forecasts, Æ’rom which all error metrics are subsequently computed.
